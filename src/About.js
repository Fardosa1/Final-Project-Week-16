// So, this is a code that I can execute as a React component. 
//When someone navigates to the "About" section of a website, I will display this 
//component on the screen. The component returns a JSX block that contains a div element with an 
//h1 element and a p element inside it. The h1 element contains the text "About" and the p element contains a message about the website's purpose.
